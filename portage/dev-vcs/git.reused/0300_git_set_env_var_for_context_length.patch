patch for git version 2.45.2
this changes a few things:
* shows exit code when external diff program fails
* allows both -UNUM and -uNUM in env.var. GIT_DIFF_OPTS, not only the latter
  ofc. --unified=NUM is still allowed
* passes GIT_DIFF_OPTS=--unified=NUM to external diff program, where NUM is the current context length that say 'git diff' uses, either due to 'git diff --unified=NUM' or due to default.
  ofc, as before, if GIT_DIFF_OPTS is set when running 'git' then it means it's exported and thus remains set as it is, and overrides wtw cmd line was passed to 'git diff' so any eg. 'git diff -UNUM' is ignored in favor of the env. var. even if the env.var. didn't have any context set!(maybe FIXME? add context length to env.var. if not specified in env.var.)

+		   long is typically 32 bits.
+		   The maximum value of a long is 2147483647 (which is 2^31 - 1).

+		   Therefore, on a 64-bit system, you would need to accommodate a 19-digit number when converting a long to a string. To safely handle this conversion, a buffer size of 21 characters should be sufficient (19 digits + optional negative sign + null terminator). */

+
+In C and many other programming languages, the size of data types like int is standardized to ensure consistency across different platforms and compilers. For a signed 32-bit integer (int), it always ranges from −231-2^{31}−231 to 231−12^{31} - 1231−1, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.
+
+Therefore, the maximum number of characters needed to represent the maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer in base 10 (without considering sign or null terminator) is consistently 10 across all platforms and systems that adhere to the standard. This ensures portability and predictability in software development.*/
