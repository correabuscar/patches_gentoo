updated for 5.1-rc3
filename changed from
drivers/video/console/fbcon.c
to
drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c

fbcon scrollback buffer can use vmalloc instead of kmalloc but it's not needed
4096KiB is plenty, the problem is that this needs to be built in kernel, not as a module, to allow for fbcon=scrollback:4096k kernel cmdline parameter to be in effect (and any other params as well, like font: )

TODO: test to see if can use more than 4096k now that kvmalloc instead of kmalloc is used!
