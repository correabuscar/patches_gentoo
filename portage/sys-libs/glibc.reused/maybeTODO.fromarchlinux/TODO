dump stacktrace on getaddrinfo ?
see:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3151779/best-way-to-invoke-gdb-from-inside-program-to-print-its-stacktrace/4611112#4611112

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77005/how-to-automatically-generate-a-stacktrace-when-my-gcc-c-program-crashes/77336#77336

man 3 backtrace

problem is, program might need to be compiled with -rdynamic
and that doesn't mean 'glibc'! but the program eg. 'ping'

do I need more macros ?

properly name the stringify macros, see:

Note:
this is where glibc arch package source is:

don't show effective user/euid if it's the same as user/uid when printing:
glibc64:../sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c:2243/getaddrinfo[11061]: pacman[11061](full:'pacman') for user root(0(eff:root(0))) 2of2 successfully resolved hostname(s):

$ ping 洧똣洧릭洧릭
'洧똣洧릭洧릭' gets transformed internally into 'f00' in glibc-2.27/sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c via __idna_to_ascii_lz inside func. gaih_inet 
and probably the only way to see it is if AI_CANONNAME flag is set when calling getaddrinfo ! and then get it from that specific field ( res->ai_canonname that is)

so even if 洧똣洧릭洧릭 exists in /etc/hosts  it won't be seen, but rather it searches for 'f00' and only this one gets resolved!

TODO: it'd be nice if we could (also?) display 'f00' when reporting successful hostname revoled in dmesg!

ok so that only happens, apparently, with /etc/hosts ! because:

that would've been really bad if this worked with normal dns!
