this patch is to debug and fix an issue in mc (midnight commander)
whereby sometimes the subshell output was truncated and if small enough
completely unshown.
The fix handles the case when the order of two different inputs
(shell output and the pwd from PROMPT_COMMAND) don't arrive in that order.
This happens sometimes and this is why the truncation happened.
Also note that shell being STOP-ped can also happen in any order with the above two.
