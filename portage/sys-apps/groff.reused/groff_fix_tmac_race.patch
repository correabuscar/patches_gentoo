Note: git groff has this code in two blocks under tmac/tmac.am ! so if this fails in the future...
///
otherwise, e.tmac and doc.tmac become bigger in size and thus 'man openrc' will sometimes fail to display properly! with bash patch only /patches/portage/app-shells/bash.reused/always_append_on_redirection.patch
The problem is that this race condition would '>' (redirect) stuff into the same file at the same time (parallel) and since O_APPEND is a flag I had added to bash to catch overwrite situations, well it's causing file to grow in size because append remember file position or something of a race that's happening inside kernel or glibc or where parallel '>' into same file is doing this!

either way, this wouldn't happen with the now-fixed Makefile
