this patch is to be applied on top of sys-apps/portage-2.3.96-r1
thanks to <grknight> on #gentoo freenode irc for leading me to this .portage_user_patches_applied file instead of .unpacked

 <dwfreed> that file is touched to indicate eapply_user was *run*
 <dwfreed> eapply_user does not necessarily apply any patches
 <dwfreed> but all that portage cares about is that eapply_user was run
